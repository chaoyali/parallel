ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gradle/
* .gradle/2.12/
* .gradle/2.12/taskArtifacts/
* .gradle/2.12/taskArtifacts/cache.properties
* .gradle/2.12/taskArtifacts/cache.properties.lock
* .gradle/2.12/taskArtifacts/fileSnapshots.bin
* .gradle/2.12/taskArtifacts/taskArtifacts.bin
* .idea/
* .idea/.name
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/hello-neon.iml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* build.properties
* default.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
