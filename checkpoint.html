<h3>Work Completed</h3> 
<ul style="list-style: none;">

  <h4>Envorinment Set Up</h4>
  <li>Build the Android Studio Develop Environment</li>
  <li>Setup the android native language development kit (NDK), which allows us to implement parts of your app using native-code languages such as C and C++.</li>
  <li>Enable the ARM Advanced SIMD: neon. The NDK supports the ARM Advanced SIMD, an optional instruction-set extension of the ARMv7 spec. NEON provides a set of scalar/vector instructions and registers (shared with the FPU) comparable to MMX/SSE/3DNow! in the x86 world.</li>
  </p>

  <h4>NEON Warm Up</h4>
  <p>
  We write some simple neon functions and pack it to neon library (.aar file) for other developer to use: addition/minus/multiple of two vector, sqrt function in 15418 assignment 1.</p>

  <h4>Implement Algorithms</h4>
  <p>We developed some algorithms and compare them with serial version or other method in Java / C: write a sort algorithm (AA-sort) in SIMD, it is 3x times quicker than serial version and 1.5x quicker than C version quick sort; we also developed a matrix multiply library for int, float and short data. The SIMD version is about 1.5x faster than serial version.</p>
</ul>




<h3>Foresee</h3>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <p>
  At first we want to develop a completed and useful parallel api for android developer. However, we then realize it is hard to develop a general / special purpose library because we do not have enough  experience on special domain and the most of general purpose do not need neon to speed them up (such as database). 
  There are some limitation in smart phone: limited energy and bad computation ability
  As a result, we want to choose some useful algorithms to implement, the algorithms include sort algorithms, matrix algorithm, scan algorithm and FFT algorithms. Because of these algorithm is frequently used in most of area and can be efficiently implemented in android smart phone.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <p>We want to show analysis of the energy consumption and efficiency. If it works well, we also want to implement a interesting application that using our library, which can show in the presentation.</p>
</ul>
